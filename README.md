## Breast Cancer Overview
### What is Breast Cancer?
Breast cancer is a malignant tumor that develops in breast cells. It is one of the most common forms of cancer affecting women. In fact, approximately 1 in 8 women (or 13%) will be diagnosed with breast cancer at one point in their lives. 

### Symptoms
From a clinical perspective, the symptoms associated with breast cancer include a lump or thickening in the breast/underarm, change in breast size or shape, skin changes on the breast, nipple changes or discharge, and pain in the breast. 

### Diagnostic Criteria
Typically, a diagnosis of breast cancer is made after a breast biopsy. However, imaging through a mammogram, ultrasound, or MRI can be used to identify suspicious areas to check with a breast biopsy.

### Prognostic Criteria
A patient's prognosis for breast cancer is made using a combination of criteria, which include cancer stage, tumor grade, biomarker status, age (younger than 60 is associated with poorer prognosis), histologic type, Ki-67 index (a marker for cell proliferation, and lymph node involvement. None of these factors are considered in isolation; rather, a combination of these factors is taken into consideration when providing a prognosis for a breast cancer patient.

### Frontline Treatment Options
Currently, the frontline treatments for breast cancer include surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy), radiation therapy, hormone therapy (tamoxifen, aromatase Inhibitors, ovarian suppression), targeted therapy (trastuzumab or pertuzumab), immunotherapy, and chemotherapy. Current chemotherapy regiments are AC-T (Adriamycin, Cyclophosphamide, followed by Taxol), TC (Taxotere and Cyclophosphamide 5), and CMF (Cyclophosphamide, Methotrexate, and 5-Fluorouracil 5). The choice of treatment depends on several factors, such as the cancer stage, tumor size/location, HER2 status (amount of breast cancer cells), and overall patient health.

### Successful Treatment Signs
A successful treatment for breast cancer would show any of the following: a reduction in tumor size, complete disappearance of the tumor, prolonged time without cancer growth, and biomarker improvements (such as a decrease in tumor markers).

### Options if Frontline Treatment Fails:
If the frontline treatment fails, there are other treatment options that can be taken. Alternative chemotherapy regimens may be recommended, advanced targeted therapies (T-DM1, tucatinib, CDK4/6 and mTOR inhibitors), and alternative immunotherapy options may be prescribed. Additionally, patients can try PARP inhibitors to see if they qualify for any clinical trials. Lastly, patients can focus on treatments targeted at symptom management and improving quality of life.

### Organs Involved in Expression of Breast Cancer
The primary site of breast cancer is breast tissue. This includes mammary glands, ducts, and lobules. However, cancer can metastasize to other sites, and common sites of metastasis include bone, lungs, liver, brain, and lymph nodes. The pattern of metastasis can vary depending on the severity and molecular subtype of breast cancer.
