## Breast Cancer Overview
### What is Breast Cancer?
Breast cancer is a malignant tumor that develops in breast cells. It is one of the most common forms of cancer affecting women. In fact, approximately 1 in 8 women (or 13%) will be diagnosed with breast cancer at one point in their lives. 

### Symptoms
From a clinical perspective, the symptoms associated with breast cancer include : a lump or thickening in the breast/underarm, change in breast size or shape, skin changes on the breast, nipple changes or discharge, and pain in the breast. 

### Diagnostic Criteria
Typically, a diagnosis of breast cancer is made after a breast biopsy. However, imaging through a mammogaram, ultrasound, or MRI can be used to identify suspicous areas to check with a breast biopsy.

### Prognostic Criteria
A patient's prognosis for breast cancer is made using a combination of criteria, which include: cancer stage, tumor grade, biomarker status, age (younger than 60 is associated with poorer prognosis), histologic type, Ki-67 index (marker for cell proliferation and lymph node involvement. None of these factors are considered in isolation, rather a combination of these factors are taken into consideration when providing a prognosis for a breat cancer patient.

### Frontline Treatment Options
Currently, the frontline treatments for breast cancer include: surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy), radiation therapy, hormone therapy (tamoxifen, aromatase Inhibitors, ovarian suppression), targeted therapy (trastuzumab or pertuzumab), immunotherapy, and chemotherapy. Current chemotherapy regiments are AC-T (Adriamycin, Cyclophosphamide, followed by Taxol), TC (Taxotere and Cyclophosphamide 5), and CMF (Cyclophosphamide, Methotrexate, and 5-Fluorouracil 5). The choice of treatment depends on several factors such as the cancer stage, tumor size/location, HER2 status (amount of breast cancer cells), and overall patient health.

### Options if Frontline Treatment Fails:



### Successful Treatment Signs
A successful treatment for breast cancer would show any of the following: a reduction in tumor size, complete dissapearance of the tumor, prolonged time without cancer growth, and biomarker improvements (such as a decrease in tumor markers).
